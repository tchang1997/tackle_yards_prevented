# DragonNet: Custom

The code in this directory was based on [Faraz Mahmoodian's Pytorch implementation of DragonNet](https://github.com/farazmah/dragonnet-pytorch). I have refactored it for my work.  

Please check out the [original DragonNet paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/8fb5f8be2aa9d6c64a04e3ab9f63feee-Abstract.html) as well (Shi, Blei, and Veitch) -- very highly recommended!
